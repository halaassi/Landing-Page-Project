### Project Description

The starter project includes HTML and CSS styling for a static Landing Page. The goal is to transform this static webpage into an interactive one using JavaScript. This involves dynamically building a navigation menu, implementing smooth scrolling, highlighting active sections based on scroll position, toggling section visibility, and adding a scroll-to-top button for enhanced user experience. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in DOM manipulation and event handling to create a responsive and engaging web experience.

### Usage

1. Navigation: The navigation menu dynamically updates based on the sections defined in the HTML. Each menu item corresponds to a section on the page.

2. Smooth Scrolling: Clicking on any menu item smoothly scrolls the page to the respective section.

3. Active Section Highlighting: As you scroll through the page, the corresponding menu item and section header are dynamically highlighted to indicate which section is currently in view.

4. Toggle Section Content: Clicking on any section header toggles the visibility of additional content within that section, allowing users to expand or collapse details as needed.

5. Scroll-to-Top Button: A "Top" button appears when scrolling down, allowing users to quickly return to the top of the page with a smooth scrolling animation.

To use the project effectively, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Navigate through the sections using the menu links or by scrolling manually. Interact with section headers to expand or collapse content. Enjoy a seamless and interactive browsing experience powered by JavaScript.
